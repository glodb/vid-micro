/*
// Package models provides data structures (models) used in the system.
//
// The models package contains struct definitions that represent data
// entities in the system. These structures serve as the foundation for
// both JSON objects and database entities. The package makes use of struct
// tags to differentiate between fields that are used for JSON serialization
// and those that are related to database operations.
//
// This package primarily focuses on declaring the structured data and
// defining the relationships between different data elements. It does
// not implement concrete functionality; instead, it establishes a clear
// and consistent structure for representing data across the system.
